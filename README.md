## Maniac Hive
Maniac Hive is a Turned based programming bot game. 
Where the two player write their own bots in the programming language python.
The bots then compete against one another by captuering the overmajority domain 
of the playing field. This is achived by moving their queen to a square and by
doing so the square have been captured and add to queen territory.

### Game mechanics
The game is played by moving the queen to new squares which is captured and 
will be indicated by your queens color. The map also have workers living one the 
and these workers can be captuered by the queen and become apart of her hive.

* Worker will do nothing until they have been captured by a queen.
  Then the worker can be controlled and manuverde around the map. 
  Lastly a worker will block the other hive queen from moving
  too the same square as the worker is currently on.

* Queen can move around the map. And each square it lands on it captures. The queen 
  can not be in the same square as a worker or queen from a different hive. If the 
  queen places herself on a squre where a uncaptuered worker is placed. That worker 
  will join the queens hive.

* The game is won when 65% of the map is captuered by a queen.
