Maniac Hive is a Turned based programming bot game. 
Where the two player write their own bots in the programming language pythons.
The bots then compete against one another by captuering the overmajority domain 
of the playing field.

### Game mechanics
The game is played by moving the queen to new "squares" which is captured and 
will be indicated by your queens color. The map also have workers living one the 
and these workers can be captuered by the queen and become apart of her hive.

* Worker in your hive can be controlled and manuverde around the map. But will
  take damage when not moving in the queens captured area. Also if a worker from 
  one hive moves to the same square as a worker from the other hive they will 
  cancel eachother out. Lastly a worker will block the other hive queen from moving
  too the same square as the worker.

* Queen can move around the map. And each square it lands on it captures. The queen 
  can not be in the same square as a worker from a different hive. If the queen moves
  to a squre where a uncaptuered worker is. That worker will join the queens hive.

* The game is won when 80% of the map is captuered by a queen.
